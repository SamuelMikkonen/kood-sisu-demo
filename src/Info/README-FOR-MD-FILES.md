# Creating and styling the markdown file

### Besides documentation a markdown file can also be a good tool to present your skills 

For the purpose of presenting your skills a well done portfolio can be a powerful tool in your disposal when applying for work. 
You could think of it as an extension of your CV (resume). For example the portfolio can be a repository in GitHub that contains all your work and including a well done README.md file will help you to showcase your productions when applying for a job.

**Note** that usually you aren't allowed to present organizational code anywhere and should therefore ask the organization if you are allowed to present your work in your portfolio. The work I'm referring here is the projects you have done with public licenses and/or you don't care if they would get copied and monetized by others. 

An example of an application or a software could be just a simple website with some functionality like navigation and some content inside the pages. It is solely to show that you can do stuff. 

The main point of this is on how you present your skills. If you create a repository and put your work there and are able to explain and navigate the reader/viewer through the most important parts you have done well in this scenario.
And this can be done with a well made .md file (README.md).

## Why do i want to create a markdown file?

Portfolios aside a well done markdown file makes it easier for others to get a grasp of what is happening in your code. You can think of this as a part of **documenting your code**. 
Also it will potentially allow anyone new to setup your application (or snippet or module what ever it is you're working on) to their own development enviroinment. 

An example of repository with a good README.md [react-dates](https://github.com/react-dates/react-dates)

## What to write inside of the .md file? 

Basically you can write anything (although that's not the point). If you checked the links above you might have gotten an idea of how the README.md file can be used to provide at least info of the code and how to set it up. 

Here are some key points to think when creating a README.md:

- What does my code do?
- How do I set it up?
- What info is ***good to know*** to make the working easier 

The ***good to know*** parts can be something like:

``` 
When creating a local developement enviroinment there is a situation X where the database has to be manually configured. 
This can be done by following the next steps: 
1.Go to ... 
2.Do ... 
3.Then... 
```

## Styling the .md file

[Here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) is a link to GitHub's own documentation on how to style the .md file.

>Note: All the styling presented in the second link may not work in all enviroinments but by testing you can reach the desired result.
