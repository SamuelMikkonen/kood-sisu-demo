# Kood/Sisu demo

### This clinic (workshop) contains the ***Basics of GitHub*** including

1. Working with branches
2. Creating and modifying the README.md (editing and what to put in there)
3. Commits - Good ways to create a commit

## What to expect?

During this clinic you should get a grasp on:

- How to work with branches
- How to modify .md files and what to put in there
- How to make commits easier to handle (for you and others)

## 1. Branches

To summarize the main idea behind the branches is: 
You normally want to create a new branch when starting to develop a new feature for the application. This is to prevent any modifications (possibly leading to a stack of errors) from being made to the product that is currently working. For example you don't want to commit your changes straight to a released application unless you are finished with the development of the feature you are/were working on.

```js
// TODO - this part only if the pull requests will be done
//You can skip this link for now and return to it after completing the other sections 

//[Version control](./src/Info/README-FOR-VERSION-CONTROL.md)
```
## 2. Markdown files

From [here](./src/Info/README-FOR-MD-FILES.md) you will find a readme that will help you styling your markdown (.md) files

## **Notice** 

There aren't just one way to do things and every company has their own way of doing things. Some guidelines are still useful when working with other people.

## 3. Commit messages

Commit messages are a way of telling what has been done. Well sure they are but why does it matter what I write in them? [More here](./src/Info/README-FOR-COMMITS.md)

 # Exercises

Totally optional and won't be graded in any way. Although you will get feedback of the done exercices if you want.

 [Here](./src/Exercises/EXERCISES.md)

 If you have done such things before and are able to present them for review you may do so instead of the exercises

# Feel free to come and discuss about the topics or coding related stuff.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
