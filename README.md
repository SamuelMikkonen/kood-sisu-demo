# Kood/Sisu demo

### This clinic (or workshop) contains the ***Basics of GitHub*** including

1. Working with branches
2. Creating and modifying the README.md (editing and what to put in there)
3. Commits - Good ways to create a commit

---------------------------------------

>### Feel free to come and discuss about the topics or coding related stuff.

----------------------------------------

## What to expect?

During this clinic you should get a grasp on:

- How to work with branches and do basic version control
- How to modify .md files and what to put in there
- How to make commits easier to handle (for you and others)


>**Notice**: There isn't just one way of doing things and every organization has their own way of doing things. Some guidelines are still useful when working with other people.


## 1. Version control (branches and pull requests)

In this clinic (workshop) we will address mainly branches and pull requests. This is in order to make this as simple as possible.

[To version control](./src/Info/README-FOR-VERSION-CONTROL.md)


## 2. Markdown files

Markdown files are a part of documenting your code. The idea is to make it easier for others to start working on the software/application and to understand how it is set up and if there are some key points to notice.

From [here](./src/Info/README-FOR-MD-FILES.md) you will find a readme that will help you style your markdown (.md) files and explains a bit on why and how to do them.


### Markdown file can also be a good tool to present your skills 

For the purpose of presenting your skills a well done portfolio can be a powerful tool in your disposal when applying for work. 
You could think of it as an extension of your CV (resume). For example the portfolio can be a repository in GitHub that contains all your work. Note that usually you aren't allowed to present organizational code anywhere and should therefore ask the organization if you are allowed to present your work in your portfolio. The work I'm referring here is the projects you have done with public licenses and/or you don't care if they would get copied and monetized by others. 

An example of an application or a software could be just a simple website with some functionality like navigation and some content inside the pages. It is solely to show that you can do stuff. 

The main point of this is on how you present your skills. If you create a repository and put your work there and are able to explain and navigate the reader/viewer through the most important parts you have done well in this scenario.
And this can be done with a well made .md file (README.md).


## 3. Commit messages

Commit messages are a way of telling what has been done. 

Well sure they are but why does it matter what I write in them? [More here](./src/Info/README-FOR-COMMITS.md)


 # Exercises

Totally optional and won't be graded in any way. Although you will get feedback of the done exercices if you want.

 [To exercises.](./src/Exercises/EXERCISES.md)

 If you have done such things before and are able to present them for review you may do so instead of the exercises.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
